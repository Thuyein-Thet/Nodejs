Node.js = Runtime Environment + JavaScript Library

Features of Node.js
-------------------

***Asynchronous and Event Driven***
All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. 
It essentially means a node based server never waits for an API to return data.
The server moves to the next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Nodes.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call.

***Very Fast***
Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in code execution.

***Single Threaded but Highly Scalable***
Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping.
Event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests.
Node.js uses a single threaded program and the same program can provide service to a much larger number of requests than traditional servers like Apache HTTP server.

***No Buffering***
Node.js applications never buffer any data.
These applications simply output the data in chunks.

***License***
Node.js is released under the MIT license.
